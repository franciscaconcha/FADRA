[FIELD]
Image_size = 1000   ; Image shape will be a square of this side length in pixels.
Margin = 50         ; Margin in pxs for star coordinates so they are not too close to image borders.

[STARS]
N_of_stars = 20     ; Number of stars to be simulated: 1 target, others will be references.
FWHM = 10           ; FWHM for "target" star.

[DARK]
Max_exp_time = 20       ; Max exposure time, in seconds. Used for dark field generation.
Max_noise_level = 0.1   ; Max noise level allowed, in terms of FWHM for target (stated above)

[FLAT]
Sky = 0

[DATA]
