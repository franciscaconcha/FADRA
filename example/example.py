# TimeSerie channels can be grouped to perform operations between them.
# Only two groups are allowed for each TimeSerie object. The default grouping is
# the first target in a group, and the rest of the targets in another group. To group channels
# differently, a mask must be applied (error channels are also grouped according to the mask):

group1_cpu_errors = ts_cpu.errors_group1()
